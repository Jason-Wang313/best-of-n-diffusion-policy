# Limitations

The experiments are synthetic and CPU-light. They are designed to isolate Best-of-N selection laws and diagnostics, not to establish real-robot performance.

The controlled diffusion-like sampler is not a full Diffusion Policy. It is labeled separately so that hand-designed sampling results are not confused with learned denoising-policy results.

The learned Diffusion Policy-lite model is intentionally small. Its role is to test whether the diagnostic pipeline applies to a learned noise-to-action generator, not to claim production-scale robot policy quality.

The image-conditioned variant uses 32x32 toy renderings and a tiny CNN. It is evidence that the diagnostic pipeline can handle image observations on CPU, not evidence for full visual manipulation benchmarks.

Calibration is not guaranteed to repair every scorer. The claim audit only promotes calibration repair when a generated artifact shows improvement in at least one regime and also records regimes without strong repair.

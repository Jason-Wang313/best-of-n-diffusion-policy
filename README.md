# Audit-Then-Sample Diffusion Policy

Paper title: Audit-Then-Sample: Certifying When Diffusion Policies Should Search More Trajectories.

This repository studies inference-time selection for stochastic diffusion action generators. Given an observation `o`, a sampler proposes `N` action trajectories, a reranker score `S(o, tau)` selects the top-scoring candidate, and the measured quantity is real task utility minus optional denoising latency cost.

The project is paper-first: the theorem is finite and tie-aware, the experiments are CPU-light, and the claim audit only promotes claims backed by CSV/JSON artifacts with confidence-interval evidence. The central fix is Audit-Then-Sample, an inference-time controller that admits high `N` only when delta-budgeted lower-bound utility, tail, diversity, and latency gates pass; otherwise it stops early, audits rollouts, repairs, increases diversity, or blocks high-`N` selection. The v4 package adds a second standard robotics benchmark bridge with Gymnasium Robotics FetchPush-v4/MuJoCo rollouts. It does not claim real-robot validation or universal Diffusion Policy improvement.

## Scientific Object

The core failure mode is diffusion tail over-selection:

- low diversity means larger `N` has little marginal value;
- high diversity plus aligned scoring can improve selected real utility;
- high diversity plus misaligned scoring can select bad high-score outliers;
- expensive denoising can make a smaller `N` or `K` preferable after latency cost.

The project is scientifically distinct from WAM and JEPA selection-law projects. It centers stochastic action-trajectory diffusion, sample diversity, denoising steps, reranker alignment, and latency-adjusted deployment rules.

## Commands

```bash
bash scripts/run_smoke.sh
bash scripts/run_all.sh
bash scripts/run_claim_audit.sh
pytest
```

Artifacts are written under `results/` by default, or `results/smoke/` for the smoke script.
The final paper build writes both `paper/iclr/final/best of n diffusion policy-v4.pdf`
and the standardized mirror `paper/final/best of n diffusion policy-v4.pdf`.

The claim audit also writes `results/ideal_metrics_status.json`; in this repo, `SUPPORTED` means the corresponding strong effect-size and CI gate in `docs/ideal_metrics.md` passed. The smoke run keeps the learned, benchmark, and deployment-stress legs small, while the full run uses multi-seed learned state/image evidence, 12-unit true-DDPM, PushT, and FetchPush simulator rollout tiers, and a 180-row sequential deployment stress suite.

See `docs/readiness.md` for the final audit inventory, strongest supported claim, weakest remaining claim, and CPU-only scope.

## Experiment Families

- Family A: controlled diffusion-like action sampler for 2D reaching/pushing.
- Family A2: Audit-Then-Sample controller audit with aligned, anti-correlated, shuffled, adversarial-tail, duplicated-artifact, correlated-pool, missing-utility, latency-spike, adaptive-stopping, repair-success, and repair-failure regimes.
- Family B: learned Diffusion Policy-lite with a state-conditioned MLP denoiser, a 32x32 image-conditioned tiny-CNN denoiser, action horizons, visual ID/OOD evaluation, seed-level summaries, CI tables, and receding-horizon execution. This is supporting evidence rather than the main diffusion-policy credibility tier.
- Family C: scorer/reranker comparison across random, diffusion proxy, behavior-cloning critic, pilot value critic, calibrated critic, misaligned tail scorer, oracle, and a calibration success/failure map.
- Family D: phase diagram over trajectory count `N` and denoising steps `K` at fixed budget pressure.
- Family E: true epsilon-prediction action DDPM with DDIM sampling, stochastic DDPM-style sampling, one-step consistency-style sampling, measured runtime, and clean-target denoiser ablation over the enabled `K` grid.
- Family F: PushT simulator benchmark path using `gym_pusht/PushT-v0`, heuristic demonstrations for CPU training, true action diffusion trajectory sampling, actual simulator rollout utility, selected coverage/success curves, reranker baselines, diversity diagnostics, and measured runtime.
- Family G: FetchPush-v4 Gymnasium Robotics/MuJoCo benchmark path with heuristic demonstrations for CPU training, true action diffusion trajectory sampling, actual simulator rollout utility, selected progress/success curves, anti-tail negative controls, diversity diagnostics, and measured runtime.
- Family H: sequential deployment stress with aligned, weak-tail, hidden-obstacle, duplicate-artifact, diversity-collapse, latency-spike, calibration-drift, missing-utility, and recovery regimes, comparing fixed low-`N`, fixed high-`N`, oracle high-`N`, static Audit-Then-Sample, and adaptive Audit-Then-Sample.

## Claim Boundary

Promoted claims must pass `scripts/run_claim_audit.sh`. Unsupported or partial claims remain research notes, not paper claims. In particular:

- do not claim real-robot validation;
- do not make universal high-`N` improvement claims;
- do not claim that calibration always repairs every bad scorer;
- do not claim that Audit-Then-Sample is a hardware safety certificate or production deployment rule;
- do not claim that a hand-designed sampler is a full Diffusion Policy model;
- do not claim full-scale visual manipulation or real-robot validation from the PushT or FetchPush paths.

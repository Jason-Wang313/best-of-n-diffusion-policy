# Claims

Claims are promotable only when supported by `results/claims_status.json` and corresponding CSV/JSON artifacts.

## Promotable Claim Categories

1. The finite tie-aware trajectory-selection law is implemented and tested.
2. High `N` can help aligned diffusion trajectory selection.
3. High `N` can hurt or saturate under scorer misalignment.
4. Low sample diversity reduces the marginal value of increasing `N`.
5. The `N` versus `K` denoising-budget tradeoff is measured.
6. Latency-adjusted utility can prefer smaller `N` or smaller `K`.
7. A calibrated scorer repairs high-`N` selection in at least one synthetic regime.
8. Audit-Then-Sample admits high `N` only when delta-budgeted lower-bound gates pass, otherwise choosing to stop early, reduce `K`, audit rollouts, calibrate the scorer, increase diversity, or block high-`N` selection, with false-admit negative controls.
9. Sequential deployment stress has zero false admits, shows fixed high-`N` is harmful in a substantial fraction of shifted decisions, and quantifies the opportunity cost of conservative high-`N` blocking in aligned/recovery regimes.
10. The project is not a WAM clone.
11. The project is not a JEPA clone.
12. Major promoted claims are backed by CSV/JSON artifacts.
13. The learned Diffusion Policy-lite experiment includes state-conditioned and 32x32 image-conditioned variants with seed-level summaries, visual OOD regimes, confidence intervals, and receding-horizon evaluation. It is supporting evidence, not the main diffusion-policy credibility tier.
14. A true epsilon-prediction action DDPM/DDIM policy reproduces the trajectory-selection law with DDIM, stochastic DDPM-style sampling, one-step consistency-style sampling, measured runtime, and the older clean-target denoiser held as an ablation.
15. A PushT simulator benchmark path reranks actual sampled action trajectories using simulator rollout utility and shows aligned gains, low-diversity saturation, misaligned-scorer failure/gap behavior, and selected coverage/success curves.
16. PushT reports selected rollout coverage and success trajectory-search curves from actual simulator rollouts.
17. Runtime recommendations are backed by both abstract `N x K` budget sweeps and measured wall-clock runtime for true diffusion and PushT sampling/rollouts.
18. Global diffusion-policy wording is promoted only when the true-DDPM and PushT rollout-metric gates pass. Controller/fix wording is promoted only when the controller/fix gate passes. Toy-controlled and learned-lite tiers remain diagnostic and supporting context.
19. The reviewer-skepticism checklist must pass: true DDPM survives, PushT survives, controller/fix evidence is present, no real-robot or full visual-policy overclaim is present, runtime evidence is present, negative controls are present, and no full-run low-power warning is active.

## Non-Claims

This repository does not claim real-robot validation, universal Diffusion Policy improvement, production-scale visual policy quality, or a production deployment rule. The PushT path is simulator evidence trained from heuristic demonstrations, not a full visual Diffusion Policy benchmark suite. The calibration map is evidence for "repairs at least one held-out lower-bound regime," not evidence that calibration always repairs high-`N` selection. Audit-Then-Sample is an audited inference-time controller for these CPU regimes, not a hardware safety certificate, and it does not certify high `N` when audited utility is missing.
